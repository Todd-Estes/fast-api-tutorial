With FastAPI, by using short, intuitive and standard Python type declarations, you get:

Editor support: error checks, autocompletion, etc.

Data "parsing"

Data validation

API annotation and automatic documentation

And you only have to declare them once.

That's probably the main visible advantage of FastAPI compared to alternative frameworks (apart from the raw performance).
